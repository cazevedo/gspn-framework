        Due to the memoryless property of the exponential transitions, it has been shown that the coverability tree of
        a bounded GSPN is isomorphic to a finite Markov Chain. Therefore in this case, we can obtain the equivalent
        continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), that comprises only tangible states.
        This mainly consists in removing all vanishing states, redirecting the arcs and computing the new stochastic
        transition rates from the weights of removed vanishing states.
        A CTMC makes transitions from state to state, independent of the past, according
        to a discrete-time Markov chain, but once entering a state remains in
        that state, independent of the past, for an exponentially distributed amount of
        time before changing state again.
        Thus a CTMC can simply be described by a transition matrix P = (P ij ), describing
        how the chain changes state step-by-step at transition epochs, together with a set of rates
        {a i : i âˆˆ S}, the holding time rates. Each time state i is visited, the chain spends, on
