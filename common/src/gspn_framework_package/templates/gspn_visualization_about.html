    <p> This module is part of a package execute and visualize robot plans using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets.</p>
    <p> This work is being developed within the scope of my Master's Thesis in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. </p>
    <p> This module is used for the offline visualization of a GSPN simulation. </p>
    <p> You can drag the places and the transitions to any place you want. </p>
    <p> You can also zoom in the network and move it around. </p>
    <p> On the left side you have the built GSPN. On the right side you have several metrics that you can test on the
    said GSPN. All you need to do is insert the input and click on the button on the right. The Result will appear inside
    the white box in the middle. </p>
    <p> If you have any suggestion or any question about the package or this specific module please contact me
